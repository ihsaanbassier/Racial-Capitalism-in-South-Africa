# Racial-Capitalism-in-South-Africa
Racism was deliberately fostered to enhance profits in colonial contexts from Africa to India and USA. Social movements highlight this ongoing link in their anti-capitalist, anti-racist calls. Yet the dialectical relation between racism and capital remains under-theorised. I explore three channels of a racialised system of capital accumulation in post-Apartheid South Africa, beyond inheritance which is well explored in the literature. Firstly, black wage-labour is conditioned by structural racial differentiation, such as occupational sorting and group-level disadvantage; secondly, the spatial system of labour relations embodied by racially segregated rural and urban spaces cheapens wage costs for capital; and thirdly, structural coercion as propagated by white institutions constrains the ability of blacks to develop organisations. I argue more generally that capitalism is not separable from racism, presenting indicative evidence that these links persist today in preserving racism as a basis of capital accumulation in South Africa. Similar channels may exist in comparable colonial contexts as well as on a world scale, and may further be present in systems of accumulation based on caste, gender or citizenship.
